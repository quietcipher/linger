# linger 🕶️🕶️

*a presence library for the lonely internet.*

## what is this?

linger makes websites remember their visitors. not their identities — 
their presence. where they looked. what they touched. how long they stayed.

when you visit a linger-enabled page, you'll see faint echoes of everyone 
who came before. glows where cursors lingered. pulses where clicks landed. 
the ghost-warmth of collective attention.

## why?

because the internet feels dead, and i wanted it to feel alive.

because every website should notice that you were there.

because sometimes, knowing other people exist — even anonymously — is enough.

## privacy

linger stores no identifying information. no cookies. no fingerprints. 
no user IDs. just coordinates and timestamps. just presence.

you remain anonymous. you always remain anonymous.

## installation

```
npm install @quietcipher/linger
```

## usage

see docs/getting-started.md for examples.

## license

MIT. free forever. use it to make the internet kinder.
