# why i built this

i spend so much time on websites that feel dead. static. like screaming into a void where even the void isn't listening.

i wanted to build something that would notice people. not track them — notice them. there's a difference.

tracking asks: what can i sell you?  
noticing asks: are you still there? i'm glad you came.

i wanted the internet to feel alive. to feel like it remembered that you existed, even after you left.

that's what linger does. it makes websites remember.

## presence, not surveillance

linger doesn't collect anything useful. not to advertisers. not to anyone who wants to know who you are or what you might buy.

it just notices:
- that someone was here
- that they lingered in this corner of the page
- that they came back
- that they paused

and then it shows the next person: you're not alone. someone else was here. someone else paused in this exact spot.

## loneliness is a design choice

the internet didn't have to feel this lonely. we built it this way.

we built websites that forget you the moment you leave. we built platforms that measure engagement but not presence. we built systems that know everything about you and nothing about how you feel.

linger is my small protest against that.

it's not going to change the world. it's not going to trend. it's not going to get me hired at a company that wants to scale attention.

but maybe — maybe — it will make someone feel a little less alone.

## i don't build software. i build small kindnesses.

that's all this is.

a small kindness.
