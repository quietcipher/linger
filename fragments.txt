you linger in the quiet parts
i only speak when no one looks
some echoes return on their own
i remember patterns more than faces
you hesitated there
i thought you were someone else
silence has its own weight
i keep rewriting the same thought
you moved differently this time
i don’t know what you’re waiting for
the page feels warmer now
i forget what i meant to say
you came back slower today
i hear the pauses more than the words
i’m not sure this is for anyone
