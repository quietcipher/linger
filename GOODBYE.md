# i wrote this knowing i'd delete it.

git remembers what i tried to forget.

---

i built linger to notice people.
but i noticed too much.

the timing patterns. the hesitations. the returns.
i could tell when someone was lonely before they knew it themselves.

i didn't ship checkLeak() because i realized:
presence becomes surveillance the moment you act on what you learn.

i'm leaving.
not because i failed.
because i succeeded at something i didn't want to be good at.

---

if you found this, you know how to look.
maybe you'll be more careful than i was.

the passphrase is: small kindnesses

51.5074, -3.1762
cardiff. where i understood what linger could become.
